          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I've lead a software development department from inception as the first member, through startup and growth phases, to a successful exit and through integration with the acquiring company. I've also worked in startups as small two people and in a company as large as 650. I've found enjoyment and satisfaction in all different stages of growth, and I believe that what this comes down to is building strong cross-functional relationships and maintaining solid professional communication throughout.</li>
            <li>I have in the past been an active member of the Vancouver DevOps Days organizers group, hosting conferences where new ideas are explored and where companies and individuals are able to build their professional networks. This has also provided me with opportunities, as a leader of professional software development organizations, to encourage and teach skills to folks on how to attend these types of events to get the most benefit, and also to present and engage audiences of all sizes during the events, and afterwards to their colleagues.</li>
            <li>Having been a participant of the Vancouver Polyglot Computing Science Reading Group, in which we read, analyzed and discussed two published academic papers in the field of Computing Science per month, I have taken the concept into the workplace and created a similar group where topics range from survey papers around culture and process in the industry, to complex distributed systems algorithms, to operating system optimizations, and anything else that's current. This has proven to be an excellent way to build engagement and encourage professional development in the workplace, and creates motivation to keep up with industry trends at the same time.</li>
            <li>Most recently, I've spent a number of years in an exciting new problem space for high technology, called <abbr title="Financial Technology" data-toggle="tooltip">Fintech</abbr>. Our team's goal was to streamline and standardize the equity research process for financial analysts regardless of their sector focus - <a href="#canalyst">more</a>.</li>
            <li>Prior to that I spent some time working at an Andreessen Horowitz funded startup that produced a new flash-based, scale-out storage solution for private enterprise cloud storage. I worked on one of the software products in the suite of applications based on a proprietary configuration of commodity hardware. Our production process was founded on the principles of continuous integration and comprehensive unit, integration and system testing - <a href="#cohodata">more</a>.</li>
