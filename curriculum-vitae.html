            <li>I spent some time working at an Andreessen Horowitz funded startup that's producing a new flash-based, scale-out storage solution for private enterprise cloud storage. I worked on one of the software products in the suite of applications based on a proprietary configuration of commodity hardware. Our production process was founded on the principles of continuous integration and comprehensive unit, integration and system testing - <a href="#cohodata">more</a></li>
            <li>I held the role of Lead Software Engineer and Principle Systems Architect for a brand-new, multi-tenanted software-as-a-service web application. Our goal was to create efficient communication and coordination channels for all concerned parties around real-world corporate events - <a href="#eventsage">more</a></li>
            <li>I've also acted as the primary developer on numerous custom high-profile mobile market research initiatives developed for the challenge of engagement and market research at high-attendance events - <a href="#tiipz">more</a></li>
