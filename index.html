            I'm a technology leader with experience building software development organizations starting from myself alone and growing up to nearly 100 engineers; through a successful exit and integration into an acquiring company. I spent the last eight years working on a successful <abbr title="Financial Technology" data-toggle="tooltip">Fintech</abbr> company and have since taken time to relax and spend with family. I'm now ready and excited to move onto the next adventure in my professional journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my career as a software developer with a Bachelor of Computing Sciences from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. I've had the pleasure of working on many small, <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> teams to produce fantastic products and user-experiences with high quality code that I, and the teams I've worked with, were very proud of. Through this experience I've become a strong advocate for constant and confident shipping of product supported by Test Driven Development and automation, often referred to as <abbr title="Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery" data-toggle="tooltip">CI/CD</abbr>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My leadership style developed from working in environments where I admired and respected other leaders and by seeking out and surrounding myself with others whom I believe foster excellent cultures of their own. It takes many seemingly small, yet extremely important, components of a culture to build a healthy environment where folks want to be successful day after day for themselves and for the company they work for.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ideal interview process is one that optimizes for success with excellent candidates. Those people that experience the process are evaluating their potential employer as much as they're being evaluated themselves, and a high degree of respect should be evident in both directions. The process should represent the job as best as possible, and I believe should involve as many of the people the candidate will interact with regularly as possible.
