            I'm a technology leader with experience building software development organizations starting from myself alone and growing up to nearly 100 engineers; through a successful exit and integration into an acquiring company. I spent eight years working on a successful <abbr title="Financial Technology" data-toggle="tooltip">Fintech</abbr> company after which I took time to relax and spend time with family before beginning my next adventure working to bring sophisticated risk factor analysis to the financial investment world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my career as a software developer with a Bachelor of Computing Sciences from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. I've had the pleasure of working on small and large <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> teams to produce fantastic products and user-experiences with high quality code that I, and the teams I've worked with, were very proud of. I'm a strong advocate for constant and confident shipping of product supported by Test Driven Development and automation, often referred to as <abbr title="Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery" data-toggle="tooltip">CI/CD</abbr>.
