            I'm a web software developer with a Bachelor of Computing Sciences from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby British Columbia. I have had the pleasure of working on small, <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile</a> teams since 2009 to produce fantastic products and user-experiences with high quality code that I, and the teams I've worked with, are very proud of. I believe in constant and confident shipping of product supported by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> and automation.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently the Lead Software Engineer at <a href="http://eventsage.com">Eventsage</a> where we build tools to make everyone a professional event planner. It has been my responsibility since the beginning of the project to ensure that we have a well-designed tool that is both intuitive for our users as well as easy to maintain and extend for new functionality into the foreseeable future.<br />
            In 2012 when we began development we decided that <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> would be one of the foundational technologies of our product despite its very recent development and we haven't regretted the choice once. It has proven to be a well-designed framework that fits our needs perfectly.<br />
            We also chose to work with <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> to build our back-end API, and while it's been fun to work with, the challenges and limitations of it have made it a less than an ideal choice.
