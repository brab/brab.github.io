      <p>I've been developing web applications professionally since 2009 using primarily <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and I've found it to be a superior toolkit for developing applications quickly and securely. In addition to Django for the backend, I am very fluent with front end technologies HTML, CSS and <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>, and can implement your design in code with ease.</p>
      <p>I am enthusiastic and energetic enough to jump into any project and reliably come out on top with a great product as a result. I look forward to constantly learning while I work in order to consistently produce the best application I can, and improve upon my own abilities while I'm at it. I take pleasure in producing very user-friendly software and I know that takes a solid foundational knowledge of server-side and front-end tools and their interactions.</p>
      <p>I'm a native Vancouverite who loves the city and province for everything they have to offer, from snowboarding, to trail biking, to back-country camping far from civilization. I play Ultimate Frisbee year round on multiple teams and try to find any other excuse I can to enjoy the outdoors of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>I'm <a href="services.html">available</a> on a consultancy basis as an experienced server-side developer and I look forward to working with you. You can check me out on <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/pub/ben-rabinovitch/22/878/563">LinkedIn</a> as well.</p>
